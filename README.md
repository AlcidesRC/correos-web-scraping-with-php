# Web Scraping with PHP

[TOC]

## Summary

This repository contains the [Sociedad Estatal de Correos y TelÃ©grafos](https://www.correos.es/) web scraper which retrieves the Spanish postcodes.

Application is built using **PHP + Guzzle + concurrent requests** to improve the performance.

Docker image and service implementation are based on [Dockerized PHP CLI](https://github.com/fonil/dockerized-php-cli), a lightweight skeleton for PHP CLI microservices.

> For further details about Requirements, Getting Started, Conventions and more, please visit [Dockerized PHP CLI README.md](https://github.com/fonil/dockerized-php-cli#readme)

## Analysis

Spanish postal codes were introduced on 1 July 1984, when the [Sociedad Estatal de Correos y TelÃ©grafos](https://www.correos.es/) introduced automated mail sorting. **They consist of five numerical digits**, where the first two digits, ranging 01 to 52, correspond either to one of the 50 provinces of Spain or to one of the two autonomous cities on the African coast.

> You can find the list of provinces and their corresponding codes at the [Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica](https://www.ine.es/en/daco/daco42/codmun/cod_provincia_en.htm).

For example:

| Province  | Province ID | Range  | Possible Postcodes   |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| Barcelona | 08          | 1..999 | 08**001**..08**999** |
| MÃ¡laga    | 29          | 1..999 | 29**001**..29**999** |
| Ceuta     | 51          | 1..999 | 51**001**..51**999** |

### Sociedad Estatal de Correos y TelÃ©grafos

[Sociedad Estatal de Correos y TelÃ©grafos](https://www.correos.es/) (a.k.a. Correos) is a state-owned company responsible for providing postal service in Spain.

This company provides [a web form from where you can find postcodes](https://www.correos.es/es/en/tools/codigos-postales/details) but, as we can see in the tab *Network* from the browser *developer tools* while performing a search, a request to retrieve postcodes suggestions is performed in background.

#### Valid Requests

```text
GET https://api1.correos.es/digital-services/searchengines/api/v1/suggestions?text=08001
```

##### Response

HTTP 200 OK

```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "text": "08001, Barcelona, Barcelona, CataluÃ±a, ESP",
      "longitude": 2.1686990270000592,
      "latitude": 41.380160001000036
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Unvalid Requests

```text
https://api1.correos.es/digital-services/searchengines/api/v1/suggestions?text=52999
```

##### Response

HTTP 200 OK

```json
{
  "code": "404",
  "message": "Not Found",
  "moreInformation": {
    "description": "Not results found.",
    "link": "www.correos.es"
  }
}
```

### Implementation

This application will accept a province ID as input, and using the previous endpoint, will check all possible postcodes and store into a CSV file the information from valid ones.

Those CSV files, one per province, will be placed at `./output/province-XX.csv` for easy processing.

> There is a special *Makefile* command for [combining all CSV files](#Combining-CSV-Files) into single one for mass processing.
